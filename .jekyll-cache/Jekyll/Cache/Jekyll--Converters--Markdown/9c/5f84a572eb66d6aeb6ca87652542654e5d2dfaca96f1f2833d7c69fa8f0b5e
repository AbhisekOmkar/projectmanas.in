When Andrew Ng said this, he wasnâ€™t talking about basic AI in its fetal stage, he was talking about deep learning based AI. Deep learning also known as  hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms. Deep learning is one of the foundations of artificial intelligence (AI), and the current interest in deep learning is due in part to the buzz surrounding AI.</p>
