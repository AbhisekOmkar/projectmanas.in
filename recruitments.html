					<li>Road Trip</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Over at Project MANAS Shivesh, Chaitanya, Dheeraj, Siddharth and Sarath were celebrating their recent acceptance in Microsoft and Amazon by going for a road trip. But gutted over the fact that they weren't invited to the trip, the juniors
					decided to play a little mischief on them. Everything is planned and everyone leaves the workshop to get some rest.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The next morning, on the day of the journey it's noticed that the cars' odometer is broken and Siddharths' OCD got triggered by that. Siddharth refused to sit inside the car until he was sure that the car could complete the trip in one
					charge.
					Now, Shrijit has a great idea. He decides to use his camera to figure out how much distance the car could travel before coming to a stop. Given Shrijit's expertise in the field,
					Siddharth agrees to finally sit in the car. However, Shrijit requires
					your help to come up with an effective algorithm which uses images to
					figure out how much distance the car has traveled so that we could plan
					the next road stop to charge the car</p>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Road Trip (Hard)</li>
				</h3>

				<p>
					Inspired by Shrijits' innovation the juniors decided to take the mischief a notch higher. This time they did not only break the newly fixed odometer but also damaged the camera lens. This time it is an even bigger problem considering the fact that
					the roads are meandering. Considering how Shrijit and you handled the problem the first time, it is now upon you to find an even better solution to this problem and end the mischief of the juniors once and for all.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>The Capricious Arm</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Siddarth was building a robot as a side project but it did not turn out as planned.
					The arm of the robot was moving spasmodically due to some faulty wiring and the only way to switch it off is by pressing the button on the wrist of the arm. Siddarth is busy with some other work so it's your job to accurately pinpoint the
					location of the bot's wrist and press the button that turns it off.

					The arm consists of 2 rods connected to each other at the elbow, and upper rod of the arm is attached to the bot's shoulder.
					Luckily you will have snaps of the arm's position across consecutive time frames which can be used to estimate the future positions of the arm.

					You will be given 'n' time frames and will have to accurately predict where the arm will be for the next 'k' time frames. The position of the bot at each time frame will be given by 2 points (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) which are the positions of
					the elbow and the wrist of the bot respectively. Using this data you will have to provide the locations of the 2 points for the next 'k' time frames.

					Sensing And Automation
				</h2>
				<p>
					The challenges for Sensing and Automation recruitments give you the opportunity to skip the interviews and get into the task
					phase. Solve the questions below to grab the opportunity. For 1st years, solving any one challenge completely and another
					partially will get you selected directly to the task phase. For the 2nd years, solving any two is compulsory and attempting the thrid one is a must.
				</p>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Embedded Systems Challenge</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					You are provided with 5 LED’s, 1 microcontroller, 3 push buttons and 1 potentiometer (250 ohms). Simulate a circuit wherein:
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
					For eg if the INPUT button is pressed 2 times then the LED array will show 0000, 0001, 0010 and reverse to 0 until the RESET
					button is pressed.
				</p> -->
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p> 1st Pushbutton represents Mode Switch </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> 2nd pushbutton represents Start Switch </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> 3rd pushbutton represents Reset Switch </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The number of times the MODE button is pressed is equivalent to the mode. For example, if he presses the button twice the mode is set as 2.</p>

				<p>Once the mode is set, the user has to press the START button to start the experiment.</p>
				<p>There are three modes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p> Volume_bar: In this mode when the potentiometer is turned clockwise the LED’s start glowing from left to right i.e. the LED on the left(1st) would glow first then the one on its right while the 1st one is still on and this would
							go on till the potentiometer has turned completely and all the LED’s are on.</p>
						<div class="grid-x">
							<!-- <div class="cell large-4 small-6">
							<img style="width:100%;height:100%" src="/static/images/jpg/challenges/embedded.jpg" />

							</div>
							<div class="cell large-auto medium-auto small-auto"></div>

						</div>
						<p>Now the potentiometer will be turned anticlockwise thus the LED’s should start switching off from left to right.</p>
						<div class="grid-x">
							<!-- <div class="cell large-4 small-6">
						<img style="width:100%;height:100%" src="/static/images/jpg/challenges/embedded.jpg" />
					</div>

							</div>
							<div class="cell large-auto medium-auto small-auto"></div>

						</div>
					</li>
					<br>
					<li>
						<p> Levels : The initial condition(when the potentiometer is at it at its left most end) is that LED1 is lit up while all the other LED’s are off . Now turning the potentiometer clockwise at a certain angle would make the LED1 turn off
							while lighting up LED2 and thus this would go on with the specific rotation of the pot.
						</p>
						<div class="grid-x">
							<!-- <div class="cell large-4 small-6">
						<img style="width:100%;height:100%" src="/static/images/jpg/challenges/embedded.jpg" />

							</div>
							<div class="cell large-auto medium-auto small-auto"></div>

						</div>
						<br>
						<p>Turning the potentiometer anticlockwise would reverse the process.</p>
						<div class="grid-x">
							<!-- <div class="cell large-4 small-6">

							</div>
							<div class="cell large-auto medium-auto small-auto"></div>

						</div>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pulse_generator : The initial condition(when the pot is at it at its left_most end)is that the LED’s would light up as a pulse i.e. The first LED would light up and then turn off and the 2nd one would light up and then it would turn
							off and so on. Thus we would see a pulse go across from LED1 to LED5 .
						</p>

						<p>Now turning the potentiometer clockwise would increase the frequency of this pulse and turning it anticlockwise would decrease it. </p>
						<p>When any mode is being executed the reset button can be pressed thus resetting the entire circuit and waiting for input at the MODE pushbutton.
						</p>
						<br>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5><span class="orange">HINTS:</span></h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Potentiometer (pot) : It gives analog values ranging from 0 to 1023. The programmer has to divide these values accordingly among the 5 LED’s for the respective Modes.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Using Arduino Uno is preferred for the question. Simulating Arduino Uno is easy on <a href="https://www.tinkercad.com" target="_blank"> Tinkercad</a> .</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h3 class="">
					<li>Planning and Control System</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Write the arduino code for a 2 wheel differential drive mobile robot to traverse and map its surroundings in a bounded room. It should be able to generate a crude map of all the obstacles along with their positions in the room using an
					ultrasonic sensor to detect the obstacles. The map should be in the form of a 20*20 array in which each element represents each move of the robot. When the robot does not detect any object the element in the array should be assigned “0”
					whereas if an object is detected, “1” should be assigned to the element. The object sizes will be defined by us. Consider the size of the mobile robot be equal to one cell.
					An example is given below.

					Mechanical
				</h2>
				<p>
					The mechanical challenge is a bonus round for you to skip the whole interview phase and directly get in the task phase. The
					challenge is divided into two parts, Mechanics and Design challenge. As a first year, you are required to attempt either
					one, but for second years it is compulsory to attempt both.The challenge is meant to test your innovative skill as well
					as your mathematical foundation.
				</p>

				<h3 class="">
					<li>Mechanics</li>
				</h3>
				<h5><u>Easy</u></h5>
				<p>
					A 4 wheeled bot initially at rest, is required to accelerate up an incline as shown in the figure below. Each of the wheels is
					powered by a DC motor with an efficiency of 70%. Find the Torque (in kg cm) produced by the motors to achieve an acceleration of
					0.5 m/s2. Also describe the motion of the bot after achieving the required torque. Given:
				</p>
				<p>
					Mass of the bot = 2 kg
					<br>
					Diameter of each wheel = 60 mm
					<br>
					Coefficient of friction = 0.3
					<br>
					Acceleration due to gravity = 9.81 m/s2
					<br>
					1 kg cm of torque produced by a motor is the same amount of torque produced by a 1kg mass acting at a distance of 1 cm.

				<h5><u>HARD</u></h5>
				<p>
					A drone is initially at rest at a distance ‘D’ meters behind a 4 wheeled bot. The bot starts traversing with a velocity ‘V’
					meters/second at time t=0 as shown in the figure below. Find the minimum time required for the drone to cross a checkpoint
					(as shown in the figure) and land safely on the bot in such a way that it does not overtake the bot during its motion
					(The motion of the bot is restricted to the XY plane and the rotation of the bot is restricted about the X and Y axis).

					Management
				</h2>
				<p>
					You are the Head of Management for a new club started this year. Considering the vast number of clubs in Manipal, it is important for a club to differentiate itself from the rest. Here are a couple of situations you would have to manage -


				</p>
				<!-- <p>
					An ideal candidate for the division would be someone who possesses one or more of the following skills:
				</p> -->

				<!-- <h3 class=""> -->
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Creating a brand for your club and publicising it is essential for recruitment and the general functioning of the club. How do you plan on spreading the word about your club, building a brand and attracting prospective members with the
							very limited resources that you have as a new club?</p>
					</li>
				<!-- </h3> -->
				<li>
					<p>
						<p>You believe that your club has a unique selling point - one that you do not share with the other organizations of Manipal. How do you plan on marketing and validating this Unique Selling Point to prospective members?</p>
					</p></li>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>You are a one-person army - with nobody else to help you to finish your tasks. These tasks include building a brand, marketing and publicity, recruitment and the general administration of your club. Rank these tasks in order of your priority and explain why you chose them. How do you plan on implementing the plans for these tasks efficiently?</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p> During recruitment, what are you looking for in a prospective member? How will you assess one's skills in a short interview/ recruitment phase?</p>
				</li>
