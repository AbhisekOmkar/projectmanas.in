					<li>Moving The Cars</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Project MANAS is taking part in a self driving car challenge. Our cars are lined up at the beginning of the road one after
					the other. The road is divided into cells. Each cell of the road is painted with a colour. The cars are run by keys
					contained in a stack each painted with a colour. When a key is used for any car, the car moves to the next unoccupied
					cell in the road having the colour of the key. If there none such cells, the move is skipped. A key can only be used
					once. As you use one key and move the car, you get the next key from the stack. Design an algorithm to get the cars
					the farthest from the source.
				</p>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Moving The Cars (Hard)</li>
				</h3>

				<p>
					Project MANAS has managed to qualify in the first round of self driving car challenge and now goes for the final round. The
					rules remain the same except that now every kth key moves the car in the backward direction to the next unoccupied cell
					in the road having the colour of the key. Design an algorithm to get the cars the farthest from the source using every
					kth move in the most productive way.

					Shreyas is coming back to his apartment after a party. Unfortunately it’s dark outside and he’s unable to see his way back
					very clearly. The way back to his apartment goes by an open lake beside an open ground. This means the darkness could
					very easily throw him off track, causing him to fall into the lake. Help him find the shores of the lake so that he
					doesn’t fall into it.

						Shreyas is stuck again. He is coming back to his apartment after another party. Unfortunately it’s dark outside and he’s
						unable to see his way back very clearly. The way back to his apartment goes by an open lake beside an open ground.
						This means the darkness could very easily throw him off track, causing him to fall into the lake. Although Shreyas
						is now prepared for these but the situation is more difficult this time because of fog. Differentiating between ground
						and lake is more difficult this time. Help him find the shores of the lake so that he doesn’t fall into it.

					Sensing And Automation
				</h2>
				<p>
					The challenges for Sensing and Automation recruitments give you the opportunity to skip the interviews and get into the task
					phase. Solve the questions below to grab the opportunity. For 1st years, solving any one challenge completely and another
					partially will get you selected directly to the task phase. All three questions are compulsory for the 2nd years.
				</p>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Embedded Systems Challenge 1</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					This is a challenge in which you have to code an arduino uno and simulate it through any simulation tool. There will be 3
					buttons namely START, RESET and INPUT. There will be 4 LEDs to represent binary digits from 0 to 15. The INPUT button
					must be pressed to enter a number between 0 and 15. After the input has been entered, the START button must be pressed.
					Once the START button has been pressed the LEDs will flash the set number (where logical 0 means the LED is OFF and
					logical 1 means its on). It will flash numbers in ascending order till it reaches the set number. Once it reaches the
					set number, the LEDs will start flashing numbers in the descending order till it reaches 0. Once it reaches zero it
					will again start flashing numbers in ascending order. It will keep bouncing between 0 and the set number till the RESET
					button is pressed. Once the RESET button is pressed, the program will be ready for input again.
				</p>
				<p>
					For eg if the INPUT button is pressed 2 times then the LED array will show 0000, 0001, 0010 and reverse to 0 until the RESET
					button is pressed.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p> If you are only able to show the input number, you will receive only 1/4 of the max points </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> If you are able to show the numbers in ascending and descending order you get 1/2 of the max points </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> If everything works you will get full points </p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					This is a challenge in which you have to design a PCB on EAGLE EDA which is a free PCB design software and is available for
					all operating systems. In this challenge you are required to make a single layered PCB in the maximum dimensions of
					17X17mm. The above given image is an image of what the schematic looks like. No schematic file will be provided. You
					must make a schematic first and then convert that schematic design into a PCB layout. The components required are given
					in the diagram.

					Mechanical
				</h2>
				<p>
					The mechanical challenge is a bonus round for you to skip the whole interview phase and directly get in the task phase. The
					challenge is divided into two parts, Mechanics and Design challenge. As a first year, you are required to attempt either
					one, but for second years it is compulsory to attempt both.The challenge is meant to test your innovative skill as well
					as your mathematical foundation.
				</p>

				<h3 class="">
					<li>Mechanics</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					An articulated robotic arm has to pick a payload of 10kg which is (20X20X20) cm. The first link length is 15 cm, second link
					length is 10 cm and third link length is 10 cm, the link weights are 2 kg, 1.5 kg, and 1.5kg respectively. Calculate
					the torque required for the three motors such that it can pick a payload in any configuration.
				</p>
				<p>
					Innovate and explore upon an idea for the mechanism of the end effector that will pick the payload considering that the arm
					is going to be placed on a bot which is of a (40X30) cm planar size.Your mission is to write a detailed report on the
					gripper mechanism and explain it with a sketch considering all real world factors.
				</p>
				<center>
					<img src="/static/images/jpg/challenges/mechanics.png" />
				</center>
				<p> The participants are required to send the picture of the math workout. Also, for a better explanation you can (optional)
					send a video explaining the solution. </p>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Design</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Adam is an autonomous bot.The rear wheels of Adam are directly coupled with DC Motors to form a differential drive and the
					front part is supported by a single caster wheel. Adam is restricted of any kind of free movement in any direction and
					can only move when power is supplied to the motors as shown in figure. Any kind of forced movements to his wheel, apart
					from motor torque can damage the gear system (worm and worm wheel) integrated in the DC motors.
				</p>
				<p>
					You have to design a mechanical system that on requirement can convert it into a freely moving bot (either manually or electrically).
					How would you end Adam’s misery?
				</p>
				<p> Your design should have the following characteristics: </p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p> Easily convertible from a restricted bot to a freely moving bot i.e. mechanically viable </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>The plan (choice of materials, strength of materials etc.) and manufacturing of the mechanism should be feasible.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> It should be cost effective. </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<img src="/static/images/jpg/challenges/design1.png" />
				<img src="/static/images/jpg/challenges/design2.png" />
				<br>
				<p> The participants are required to send either a proper diagram of the mechanism or can design the mechanism on any CAD
					software. Along with that, participants are also required to submit a written report or a video explaining the mechanism.
					Any CAD software may be used for the challenge. Some recommended are CATIA, SolidWorks, Inventor, Fusion 360. </p>
