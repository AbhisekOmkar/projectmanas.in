				The challenges for AI recruitments have been hosted on Hackerrank. The contest will go live on 15th August, 2018. The challenges include easy and hard challenges. 2nd years need to solve all of them to be considered eligible for direct entry. The hard challenges are optional for the 1st years. The challenge shall remain open till 6th Semptember, 2018.

					Project MANAS is taking part in a self driving car challenge. Our cars are lined up at the beginning of the road one after the other. The road is divided into cells. Each cell of the road is painted with a colour. The cars are run by keys contained in a stack each painted with a colour. When a key is used for any car, the car moves to the next unoccupied cell in the road having the colour of the key. If there none such cells, the move is skipped. A key can only be used once. As you use one key and move the car, you get the next key from the stack. Design an algorithm to get the cars the farthest from the source.

					Project MANAS has managed to qualify in the first round of self driving car challenge and now goes for the final round. The rules remain the same except that now every kth key moves the car in the backward direction to the next unoccupied cell in the road having the colour of the key. Design an algorithm to get the cars the farthest from the source using every kth move in the most productive way.
