				<p>
					The challenges for AI recruitments have been hosted on HackerRank. The challenges
					includes easy and hard challenges.
					The challenge shall remain open till 10th September, 2019.

				<h3 class="">
					<li>Road Trip</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Over at Project MANAS Shivesh, Chaitanya, Dheeraj, Siddharth and Sarath were celebrating their recent acceptance in Microsoft and Amazon by going for a road trip. But gutted over the fact that they weren't invited to the trip, the juniors
					decided to play a little mischief on them. Everything is planned and everyone leaves the workshop to get some rest.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					The next morning, on the day of the journey it's noticed that the car's odometer is broken and Siddharth's OCD got triggered by that. Siddharth refused to sit inside the car until he was sure that the car could complete the trip in one
					charge.
					Now, Shrijit has a great idea. He decides to use his camera to figure out how much distance the car could travel before coming to a stop. Given Shrijit's expertise in the field,
					Siddharth agrees to finally sit in the car. However, Shrijit requires
					your help to come up with an effective algorithm which uses images to
					figure out how much distance the car has traveled so that we could plan
					the next road stop to charge the car</p>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Road Trip (Hard)</li>
				</h3>

				<p>
					Inspired by Shrijit's innovation the juniors decided to take the mischief a notch higher. This time they not only broke the newly fixed odometer but also damaged the camera lens. This time it is an even bigger problem considering the fact that
					the roads are meandering. Considering how Shrijit and you handled the problem the first time, it is now upon you to find an even better solution to this problem and end the mischief of the juniors once and for all.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>The Capricious Arm</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Siddarth was building a robot as a side project but it did not turn out as planned.
					The arm of the robot was moving spasmodically due to some faulty wiring and the only way to switch it off is by pressing the button on the wrist of the arm. Siddarth is busy with some other work so it's your job to accurately pinpoint the
					location of the bot's wrist and press the button that turns it off.

					The arm consists of 2 rods connected to each other at the elbow, and upper rod of the arm is attached to the bot's shoulder.
					Luckily you will have snaps of the arm's position across consecutive time frames which can be used to estimate the future positions of the arm.

					You will be given 'n' time frames and will have to accurately predict where the arm will be for the next 'k' time frames. The position of the bot at each time frame will be given by 2 points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) which are the positions of
					the elbow and the wrist of the bot respectively. Using this data you will have to provide the locations of the 2 points for the next 'k' time frames.

					Sensing And Automation
				</h2>
				<p>
					The challenges for Sensing and Automation recruitments give you the opportunity to skip the interviews and get into the task
					phase. Solve the questions below to grab the opportunity.
					Deadline is 10th September.
				</p>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Hardware and PCB Designing Challenge</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Design a Buck Converter Circuit with LM2596 IC (use datasheet for reference)and the following specifications:
				</p>
				<!-- <p>
					For eg if the INPUT button is pressed 2 times then the LED array will show 0000, 0001, 0010 and reverse to 0 until the <b>RESET</b>
					button is pressed.
				</p> -->
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p> Input Voltage: 18V to 25.2V </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Output Voltage: 5V </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Max Output Current: 3A </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Appropriate connectors for I/O </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Suitable protection features as applicable </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Design a single layer PCB along with schematic using Autodesk Eagle.</p>
				
				<h5><span class="orange">Judging Criteria</span></h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p> Efficiency of the Circuit and PCB </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Appropriate Component Selection (price and availability) </p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p> Minimum size of PCB </p>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h5><span class="orange">Bonus Task</span></h5>
				<p>Additionally, you can simulate the above designed circuit in any simulation software, it is optional, but extra points would be awarded.</p>

				<br>
				
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Embedded Systems Challenge</li>
				</h3>
				
				<p>You have 7 pushbuttons, 1 potentiometer (250 ohms), 4 <b>LEDs</b>, 1 microcontroller.</p>
				<p>Arrange the above components and simulate a circuit wherein:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>Pushbuttons 1-4 represent <b>TOGGLE</b> buttons</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pushbutton 5 represents <b>ALL_ON</b> button</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pushbutton 6 represents <b>ALL_OFF</b> button</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pushbutton 7 represents <b>MODE</b>  button</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>Pushbutton 8 represents <b>RESET</b> button</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					The number of times the <b>MODE</b> button is pressed is the mode of operation. For example, if the <b>MODE</b> button is pressed twice, the mode should be set as 2. Once the mode is set, the circuit should execute the desired functions.
				</p>

				<p>
					The press of the <b>RESET</b> button should reset the entire system (while possibly still in operation), allowing the user to input the mode again.
				</p>

				<p>
					There are 3 modes to be developed:
				</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p><span class="orange">Toggle:</span> In this mode, the press of any of the <b>TOGGLE</b> buttons should cause a corresponding <b>LED</b> to start glowing, maintaining its state. When a second <b>TOGGLE</b> button is pressed, the corresponding <b>LED</b> to that button should start glowing along with the previous <b>LED</b>. If a <b>TOGGLE</b> button to an already lit <b>LED</b> is pressed, the corresponding <b>LED</b> should stop glowing, leaving the state of the other <b>LEDs</b> unchanged. Please note that when an <b>LED</b> is made to glow, it should stay glowing till its state is toggled. The press of the <b>ALL_ON</b> button should cause all the <b>LEDs</b> to glow, and the press of the <b>ALL_OFF</b> button should cause all <b>LEDs</b> to stop glowing.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><span class="orange">Pulse:</span> In this mode, all the <b>LEDs</b> must pulsate (start glowing and stop glowing in a cycle) with a frequency based on the input from the potentiometer. Turning the potentiometer clockwise should increase the frequency, turning it anticlockwise should decrease it. Pushing of any pushbuttons 1-7 should not affect the pulse executed in this mode.</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p><span class="orange">Memory:</span> In this mode, the <b>LEDs</b> must glow in the order decided by the sequence with which the pushbuttons are pressed. For example, take the following sequence:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<p>1 &rArr; 3 &rArr; 1 &rArr; <b>ALL_ON</b></p>
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					After taking any such sequence as input, the pressing of the <b>ALL_OFF</b> button should cause the <b>LEDs</b> to glow in the same sequence, with the speed of change to the next state being decided by the input from the potentiometer, similar to <span class="orange">Pulse</span> mode.
				</p>

				<p>
					<span class="orange">Hints:</span> Use of arrays may help design the above system. The use of Arduino is preferred for this question. Simulating is easy on Tinkercad. Name all variables in the code appropriately for more readability and easy debugging.
				</p>


				<br>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Planning and Control System Challenges</li>
				</h3>
				<p>
					You are building an intelligent robotic spy to spy on an alleged criminal. The robot spy is equipped with many sensors utilizing which it would relay important information regarding the alleged to you. The base of the robot is a 2-wheeled differential drive robot with 5 ultrasonic sensors arranged as shown.

					</div>
				</div>
				
				<h4><span class="orange">LEVEL-1 TASK</span></h4>
				<p>Design an approach and write code to program the robot to follow the suspect in a bounded unknown environment with only rectangular obstacles. The robot must also avoid the obstacles as it tries to follow the target. The constraint is to stay close to the target but not too close to avoid getting caught. The ideal radius to spy on is between 1m to 2m.</p>
				<h5><span class="orange">Assumptions:</span></h5>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>
							Assume that you receive the position of the target from the command center in the form of (x, y) coordinates w.r.t the bottom left of the bounded field which is to be considered the origin I.e., (0, 0).
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Also assume that you know your global position (x,y,theta) in the field (w.r.t the origin) from an in-built positioning system.
						</p>
					</li>
					<li>
						<p>
							Robot always starts from origin(0,0,0).
						</p>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<h4><span class="orange">LEVEL-2 TASK</span></h4>
				<p>The robotic spy was working according to the expectations but now the in-built positioning system has failed, now you can’t expect the robot to know its current position(x,y,theta).</p>
				<p>Modify the approach in order to make this system work satisfactorily. The assumption that robot always starts from origin still holds.</p>
				
				<p>An example environment is given below with the differential drive robot</p>

				<div class="grid-x grid-margin-x">

					</div>
				</div>

				<p><span class="orange"> Hint:</span> How would the robot be able to keep track of its position?</p>

				<h5><span class="orange">Judging Criteria</span></h5>
				<p> The approach to solve the problem would be given more importance. An abstract (but detailed) code to solve the problem would suffice (Programming language of your choice).</p>

					Mechanical
				</h2>
				<p>
					The mechanical challenge is a bonus round for you to skip the whole interview phase and directly get in the task phase. The
					challenge is divided into two parts, Mechanics and Design challenge. As a second year it is compulsory to attempt both. The challenge is meant to test your innovative skill as well
					as your mathematical foundation.
				</p>

				<h3 class="">
					<li>Mechanics</li>
				</h3>
				<h5><u>Easy</u></h5>
				<p>
					A 4 wheeled bot initially at rest, is required to accelerate up an incline as shown in the figure below. Each of the wheels is
					powered by a DC motor with an efficiency of 70%. Find the Torque (in kg cm) produced by the motors to achieve an acceleration of
					0.5 m/s^2. Also describe the motion of the bot after achieving the required torque. Given:
				</p>
				<p>
					Mass of the bot = 2 kg
					<br>
					Diameter of each wheel = 60 mm
					<br>
					Coefficient of friction = 0.3
					<br>
					Acceleration due to gravity = 9.81 m/s^2
					<br>
					1 kg cm of torque produced by a motor is the same amount of torque produced by a 1kg mass acting at a distance of 1 cm.

					</center>
				</div>
				<h5><u>HARD</u></h5>
				<p>
					A drone is initially at rest at a distance ‘D’ meters behind a 4 wheeled bot. The bot starts traversing with a velocity ‘V’
					meters/second at time t=0 as shown in the figure below. The drone can attain a maximum acceleration of 'A' in any direction (excluding acceleration due to gravity). Find the path that requires minimum time for the drone to cross a checkpoint
					(as shown in the figure) and land <strong>safely</strong> on the bot in such a way that it does not overtake the bot during its motion
					(The motion of the bot is restricted to the XY plane and the rotation of the bot is restricted about the X and Y axis).

				</div>
				<p><strong> The participants are required to send the picture of the math workout.</strong></p>
				<h3 class="">
					<li>Design</li>
				</h3>
				<h5><u>EASY</u></h5>
				<p>
					Design a mechanism to actuate a ball and socket joint. The design should be efficient and should control all possible directions
					of movement of the joint so that it can be used in Automotives.
				</p>
				<h5><u>HARD</u></h5>
				<p>
					Design a robot/robotic arm such that it can hold a given ball of any dimension and can give a controlled 3-D oriented movement to it.
					Diameter of the ball given will be from the range 5cm to 25cm. Use as few materials as possible.
